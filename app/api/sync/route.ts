 * Use the focused sync routes instead:
 *   /api/sync/dreps      (every 6h) — Core DRep enrichment
 *   /api/sync/votes      (every 6h) — Bulk votes + reconciliation
 *   /api/sync/proposals  (every 30m) — Proposals + voting summaries
 *   /api/sync/secondary  (every 6h) — Delegators, power, integrity
 *   /api/sync/slow       (daily)     — Rationales, AI, links, hashes
 *
 * All syncs are orchestrated via Inngest. See inngest/functions/ for details.
