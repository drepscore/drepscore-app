# Product Vision — DRepScore

## Core Thesis
DRepScore is a **governance relationship platform**, not a DRep directory. Treat users as governance citizens, not DRep shoppers.

## Design Principles
1. **Story first, data second.** Every screen tells a story before showing a spreadsheet.
2. **Financial stakes are real.** Connect governance decisions to ADA holdings.
3. **Emotional moments matter.** Design for celebration, warning, pride, and discovery — not just information.
4. **Mobile is primary.** Design for phones, adapt for desktop.
5. **Viral by design.** Every feature should have a shareable output.
6. **Progressive complexity.** Simple by default, powerful on demand.
7. **Return users ≠ new users.** The homepage adapts. "Since you were last here" > "Welcome."

## Two User Segments

**ADA Holders:** Not shoppers — citizens. Show them financial stakes, representation quality, and community identity.

**DReps:** Not report-card readers — commanders. Give them an actionable dashboard with delegation management, competitive context, gamification, and positioning tools.

## Key UX Rules
- Never show marketing copy to a returning authenticated user
- Empty states must guide, educate, and motivate — never just "no results found"
- Scores must tell stories: "72 means your DRep is solid but missed 3 recent votes" — not just "72"
- Filter controls: progressive disclosure (search + sort visible, rest behind "Filters")
- Every shareable moment needs a beautiful, branded output image
