# Analytics & Observability Protocol

Every feature or meaningful change must include analytics considerations in the plan. Skip only for purely cosmetic or trivial changes.

## Planning Checklist (Answer Before Building)

1. **Events**: What user/system actions should be tracked?
   - Client-side: `posthog.capture()` via `lib/posthog.ts` for user interactions
   - Server-side: `captureServerEvent()` via `lib/posthog-server.ts` for API/sync events
   - Naming: `noun_verb` (e.g., `drep_claimed`, `rationale_submitted`, `wallet_connected`)

2. **Properties**: What context should each event carry?
   - Always include: relevant entity IDs, action outcome (success/failure), timing
   - For DRep actions: `drep_id`, `score`, `tier`
   - For user actions: wallet stake address (if connected), session context

3. **Dashboard Impact**: Does this change affect existing Observable pages?
   - Pages: Executive Overview, DRep Performance, Governance Activity, Voting Intelligence, Score Trends, DRep Engagement, Data Quality
   - New data dimension → new or updated data loader in `analytics/src/data/`
   - New feature category → consider new dashboard page in `analytics/src/`

4. **Alerts**: Should this trigger or update alerting?
   - Integrity alerts (`/api/admin/integrity/alert`) — data quality thresholds
   - Sync monitoring (`sync_log` table, `/api/admin/inbox-alert`)
   - Consider: failure rates, anomaly detection, SLA breaches

5. **Supabase Data**: If new tables/columns are added, do Observable data loaders need updating?
   - Data loaders: `analytics/src/data/*.json.ts` — query Supabase directly
   - New tables that surface metrics should get a corresponding loader

## Existing Instrumentation Map

| Layer | Tool | Location |
|-------|------|----------|
| Client events | PostHog JS SDK | `lib/posthog.ts`, components |
| Server events | PostHog Node SDK | `lib/posthog-server.ts`, API routes |
| Dashboards | Observable Framework | `analytics/src/*.md` (12 pages incl. growth) |
| Data loaders | Observable + Supabase | `analytics/src/data/*.json.ts` (17 loaders) |
| Alerts | Cron + webhooks | `/api/admin/integrity/alert`, `/api/admin/inbox-alert` |
| In-app alerts | `useAlignmentAlerts` hook | `hooks/useAlignmentAlerts.ts` |
| Sync health | Supabase `sync_log` | `/api/sync/*` routes |

### Governance DNA / Discovery Events (Session 2)

| Event | Type | Location | Properties |
|-------|------|----------|------------|
| `governance_dna_quiz_started` | Client | `GovernanceDNAQuiz` | `proposal_count` |
| `governance_dna_quiz_vote` | Client | `GovernanceDNAQuiz` | `vote`, `proposal_type`, `question_number` |
| `governance_dna_quiz_completed` | Client | `GovernanceDNAQuiz` | `votes_count`, `top_match_score`, `matches_found` |
| `governance_dna_quiz_retake` | Client | `GovernanceDNAQuiz` | `previous_votes_count` |
| `governance_matches_calculated` | Server | `/api/governance/matches` | `matches_count`, `top_match_score`, `has_current_drep_match` |
| `drep_view_mode_changed` | Client | `DRepTableClient` | `mode` |
| `drep_quick_view_opened` | Client | `DRepTableClient` | `drep_id`, `drep_score`, `has_match`, `view_mode` |

### Page View Tracking (Session 8)

Use `<PageViewTracker event="..." />` in server-rendered pages to capture client-side page views without converting to a client component:

| Event | Page |
|-------|------|
| `homepage_viewed` | `app/page.tsx` |
| `discover_page_viewed` | `app/discover/page.tsx` |
| `proposals_page_viewed` | `app/proposals/page.tsx` |
| `compare_page_viewed` | `app/compare/page.tsx` |
| `governance_page_viewed` | `app/governance/page.tsx` |
| `governance_calendar_fetched` | Server: `/api/governance/calendar` |
| `calendar_proposal_clicked` | Client: `GovernanceCalendar` |

### Observable Data Loaders Added (Session 8)

| Loader | Data |
|--------|------|
| `notification-log.json.ts` | Notification delivery and read rates |
| `user-activity.json.ts` | User signups, claims, daily activity |
| `governance-events.json.ts` | Poll activity, watchlist activity |

## Implementation Standards

- **Don't ship dark features**: If a user can interact with it, it should emit at least one PostHog event
- **Server events for business logic**: Sync completions, claims, alert triggers — use `captureServerEvent()`
- **Dashboard-worthy = data loader**: If you'd want to chart it, create the data loader alongside the feature — not as a follow-up
- **Alert on failure paths**: Any new cron, sync, or webhook must capture failure events with error context
