# DRepScore Coding Conventions

## TypeScript
- Strict mode, no `any` types, no `@ts-ignore`
- Use interfaces for object shapes, type aliases for unions/intersections
- Prefer `const` over `let`, never `var`
- Import alias: `@/*` maps to project root

## React / Next.js
- Server components by default — only use `"use client"` when interactivity is required
- App Router conventions: `page.tsx`, `layout.tsx`, `loading.tsx`, `error.tsx`
- Keep client components small and focused
- Loading skeletons for every data-dependent component

## Data Access
- **All frontend reads go through `lib/data.ts`** — this queries Supabase
- **Never** add direct Koios API calls to frontend/server components
- Koios calls only in `utils/koios.ts` (used by sync scripts)
- Supabase client via `lib/supabase.ts`

## UI
- shadcn/ui components — never build custom when shadcn has it
- Tailwind CSS v4 utility classes — no custom CSS unless absolutely necessary
- Dark mode via `next-themes` — always support both themes
- Responsive design: mobile-first approach

## Scoring
- DRep Score (0-100): Rationale Quality 35%, Effective Participation 30%, Reliability 20%, Profile Completeness 15%
- Voting power/influence is explicitly excluded from scoring
- Size tiers: Small (<10k), Medium (10k-1M), Large (1M-10M), Whale (>10M ADA)

## File Naming
- Components: PascalCase (`DRepCard.tsx`)
- Utilities/libs: camelCase (`scoring.ts`, `data.ts`)
- API routes: `route.ts` inside App Router directories
- Types: `types/` directory, PascalCase for type/interface names

## Error Handling
- API routes: try-catch with `NextResponse.json({ error }, { status })` pattern
- Never swallow errors silently — log with context
- Wallet operations: phase callbacks for progress tracking

## Database
- Migrations in `supabase/migrations/` with sequential 3-digit prefix
- Table names: snake_case
- Always validate migration results before proceeding to application code

## Testing
- Vitest 3.x (v4 broken on Node 24)
- Test files: `*.test.ts` or `*.test.tsx` colocated with source
- Descriptive test names: "should [behavior] when [condition]"

## Git
- Conventional commits: `feat:`, `fix:`, `refactor:`, `test:`, `docs:`, `chore:`
- Build must pass (`npm run build`) before pushing
- No console.log in committed code — use proper logging
- No hardcoded secrets — environment variables only
