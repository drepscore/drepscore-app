## Overview

Long-term vision for expanding beyond DRepScore into a broader Cardano ecosystem engagement platform — Governance-as-a-Service SDK, Cardano Citizen Hub, and complementary projects.

## Open Questions

- [ ] What Cardano DAOs exist today that could use governance tooling?
- [ ] Is there demand for a unified Cardano dashboard (governance + staking + Catalyst)?
- [ ] What does "Cardano Citizen Score" gamification look like without being gimmicky?
- [ ] SDK vs API vs white-label — what do projects actually want?

## Concept: Governance-as-a-Service SDK
Plug-and-play governance modules for Cardano-based DAOs and projects.

## Concept: Cardano Citizen Hub
Unified dashboard for all Cardano ecosystem participation — governance, staking, Catalyst, community.

## Concept: Cardano Governance Newsletter
Weekly data-driven governance report leveraging DRepScore data. Sponsor-supported.

## Next Actions

1. Map the Cardano DAO landscape
2. Identify 3 potential complementary projects worth exploring
3. Validate newsletter concept with community engagement metrics
