## Overview

Apply DRepScore's accountability framework to Project Catalyst — scoring proposal reviewers, tracking funded project delivery, and providing fund allocation analytics.

## Open Questions

- [ ] What Catalyst data is publicly available via API?
- [ ] What's the current state of Catalyst reviewer accountability?
- [ ] Is there community demand for this? (forum/Reddit sentiment)
- [ ] Can this share infrastructure with DRepScore or does it need its own stack?
- [ ] Catalyst funding timeline — when is the next fund?

## Research Needed

1. Catalyst API documentation and data availability
2. Existing tools in the Catalyst space (competitors/complements)
3. Community pain points around Catalyst accountability
4. Fund cycle timing for both building and applying for funding

## Next Actions

1. Map available Catalyst data sources
2. Talk to Catalyst community members about pain points
3. Assess technical feasibility and shared infrastructure potential
