## Overview

Leverage Midnight's zero-knowledge proof capabilities to build privacy-preserving governance tools — anonymous reputation, confidential delegation analytics, and privacy-preserving voting verification.

## Open Questions

- [ ] What's Midnight's current development status? (devnet/testnet/mainnet timeline)
- [ ] What ZK primitives does Midnight expose to developers?
- [ ] What's the developer tooling like? SDK maturity?
- [ ] Is there Midnight ecosystem funding available?
- [ ] What governance use cases genuinely benefit from privacy?

## Concept Ideas

### Privacy-Preserving Governance Reputation
Prove you're an active, high-scoring governance participant without revealing your identity.

### Confidential Delegation Analytics
Institutional delegators who want governance intelligence without exposing their positions.

### Cross-Chain Governance Bridge
Cardano governance participation verified on Midnight.

## Next Actions

1. Track Midnight devnet/testnet announcements
2. Review Midnight developer documentation when available
3. Identify 2-3 concrete use cases worth prototyping first
