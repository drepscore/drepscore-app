      <p>
        A <strong>Delegated Representative (DRep)</strong> is a governance participant in the Cardano blockchain 
        who votes on behalf of ADA holders who delegate their voting power to them.
      </p>
      <p>
        Think of DReps as elected representatives in traditional government, but for blockchain governance. 
        They vote on proposals that affect the Cardano ecosystem, including:
      </p>
      <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-1">
        <li>Treasury funding allocations</li>
        <li>Protocol parameter changes</li>
        <li>Constitutional amendments</li>
        <li>Hard fork decisions</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        By delegating to a DRep, you give them the power to vote with your stake weight, 
        while you retain full control of your ADA.
      </p>
    </InfoModal>

export function ParticipationRateModal() {
  return (
    <InfoModal title="Understanding Effective Participation" triggerVariant="ghost" iconOnly>
      <p>
        <strong>Effective Participation</strong> measures how actively and thoughtfully a DRep engages with governance proposals.
      </p>
      <p>
        It's calculated as: (Participation Rate) × (Deliberation Modifier)
      </p>
      <div className="bg-muted p-4 rounded-lg space-y-2">
        <p className="font-medium">Deliberation Modifier</p>
        <p className="text-sm text-muted-foreground mb-2">
          This modifier penalizes rubber-stamping (voting the same way on every proposal):
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-1 text-sm">
          <li>&gt;95% same vote direction: 30% penalty</li>
          <li>&gt;90% same vote direction: 15% penalty</li>
          <li>&gt;85% same vote direction: 5% penalty</li>
          <li>≤85% same vote direction: No penalty</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <p>
        A higher effective participation rate indicates a DRep who shows up consistently AND demonstrates 
        thoughtful consideration rather than voting uniformly on every proposal.

    <InfoModal title="Why Rationale Matters" triggerVariant="ghost" iconOnly>
      <p>
        <strong>Rationale</strong> refers to the written explanation a DRep provides for their votes.
      </p>
      <p>
        High-quality DReps provide rationale because:
      </p>
      <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
        <li>
          <strong>Transparency</strong> - You can understand their decision-making process
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Accountability</strong> - They publicly justify their positions
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Education</strong> - Helps you learn about complex governance issues
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Trust Building</strong> - Shows thoughtful consideration of proposals
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        When selecting a DRep, look for those with high rationale provision rates (80%+) and 
        review their past rationales to ensure their reasoning aligns with your values.
      </p>
      <p className="text-sm text-muted-foreground">
        Note: Rationale is weighted by proposal importance — critical governance votes (hard forks, 
        constitutional changes) count 3x more than routine votes. Rationale must be at least 50 
        characters to count. DReps who list social/communication channels in their CIP-119 profile 
        receive credit via the Profile Completeness score.

          <h4 className="font-semibold text-green-600 dark:text-green-400 mb-2">Myth: Delegation Locks Your ADA</h4>
          <p>
            <strong>FALSE.</strong> Your ADA remains in your wallet and is always accessible. 
            You can spend, move, or redelegate at any time. Delegation only affects voting power, not ownership.
          </p>

        <div>
          <h4 className="font-semibold text-yellow-600 dark:text-yellow-400 mb-2">Risk: Poor DRep Performance</h4>
          <p>
            A DRep who rarely votes or votes against your values may not represent you well. 
            Solution: Monitor their activity and redelegate if needed. There's no penalty for changing DReps.
          </p>
        </div>
        
        <div>
          <h4 className="font-semibold text-blue-600 dark:text-blue-400 mb-2">Best Practice: Stay Informed</h4>
          <p>
            Regularly check your DRep's voting record and rationales. The governance landscape 
            evolves, and what aligned with your values yesterday may not tomorrow.
